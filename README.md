**category:** Category of the campaign (e.g., social, search, influencer).
**campaign_id:** Unique identifier for the campaign.
**impressions:** Number of impressions (how many times an ad was shown).
**mark_spent:** Total amount spent on the campaign.
**clicks:** Number of clicks on the ad.
**leads:** Number of leads generated (potential customers).
**orders:** Number of orders generated.
**revenue:** Total revenue generated from the campaign.
